Event & Festivity Pricing Agent  (formerly "Calendar Agent")
Dynamic Pricing POC - LangGraph + Gemini + Kafka + Supabase

Rewritten to match the Inventory agent's architecture and unified contract:
  - The pricing decision (action / price_modifier / confidence_score) is now
    computed deterministically in Python (determine_decision_node), never by
    the LLM. The LLM's only job is to write headline + detailed_reasoning,
    which is schema-validated (Pydantic) with a deterministic fallback - so
    an odd/malformed Gemini response can no longer crash the whole run (the
    old version had zero error handling around the LLM call at all).
  - price_modifier is a SIGNED FRACTIONAL DELTA everywhere (0.0857 = +8.57%,
    -0.05 = -5%, 0.0 = no change), not a multiplier - so every action's
    modifier stays comfortably under 1.0, instead of only DISCOUNT landing
    there naturally while SURCHARGE/HOLD broke that pattern under the old
    multiplier representation.
  - Token usage + cost is tracked and logged exactly like the inventory agent.
  - Two LOCAL audit logs are written every run: event_agent_proposals.jsonl
    and event_agent_validations.jsonl (same shape/spirit as the inventory
    agent's proposals.jsonl/validations.jsonl, kept under separate filenames
    so the two agents don't clobber each other's logs if run from the same
    cwd). These are distinct from the Supabase event_proposals TABLE below -
    one's a local file, one's a remote table, deliberately not given the
    identical name.
  - Every proposal is published to BOTH:
      1. Kafka, on the "event-agent" topic (kafka_publisher.py)
      2. Supabase, as a row in the "event_proposals" table (supabase_client.py)
    using the SAME external contract as the inventory agent
    (agent_id / sku / recommendation{action, suggested_modifier, confidence} /
    rationale), built once and validated once (build_proposal_payload), then
    published to each transport independently - if one fails (broker down,
    Supabase unreachable), the other still goes through.
    HOLD_EXEMPT collapses to HOLD on the wire; the exemption itself stays
    visible in metrics_evaluated.surcharge_exempt_triggered for audit/UI use.
  - The product catalog is fetched from Supabase's products_sku table
    (supabase_client.fetch_products) instead of a CSV file.
  - SKUs with no festival AND no public holiday in the lookahead window skip
    the LLM call entirely (skip_justification_node) and get a deterministic
    HOLD, mirroring the inventory agent's skip_no_risk_node - this will be
    the majority of rows on most days, so it meaningfully cuts LLM cost.
  - Removed dead code (unused route_has_festival, MOCK_FESTIVAL_CALENDAR,
    bootstrap_festival_json, unused imports) and the /mnt/user-data/uploads
    CSV-copy hack from main().
  - today_str now defaults to the real current UTC date (overridable via the
    CALENDAR_AGENT_TODAY env var for backtesting), instead of being
    hardcoded to one specific date.
  - GEMINI_API_KEY is read inside main() instead of at import time, so
    importing build_graph() (e.g. from an orchestrator) no longer crashes
    the process if the env var isn't set yet.
  - The festival calendar and the `holidays` library's calendar are loaded
    ONCE per run (load_catalog_node) instead of being re-read/recomputed on
    every single row.

Graph nodes:
    load_catalog -> check_next_sku -> scan_festivals -> check_holidays
                 -> compute_lift -> determine_decision -> assign_urgency
                 -> [skip_justification | call_llm] -> build_output
                 -> advance_row -> (loop or END)

A pricing decision (suggested_action, price_modifier, confidence_score) has
ALREADY been made deterministically in Python from the metrics below. Do not
change it, recompute it, or second-guess it. Your only job is to write a
short headline and a 2-3 sentence detailed_reasoning that explains WHY that
decision makes sense, grounded in the specific numbers you were given
(festival name, days_to_event, demand_lift_factor, public_holiday,
surcharge_exempt_triggered, decided_action, decided_price_modifier, etc).

IMPORTANT - decided_price_modifier is a SIGNED FRACTIONAL CHANGE, not a
multiplier: 0.0857 means "raise the price by 8.57%", -0.05 means "drop the
price by 5%", 0.0 means "no change". Describe it that way (e.g. "an 8.57%
surcharge") - do not describe it as if it were the new price's multiplier.

Be concrete, never vague. Do not use hand-wavy phrases like "significant
risk", "moderate confidence", "various factors", "some units", "a portion
of", or "relatively high/low". Every sentence must cite at least one
specific number you were actually given.
